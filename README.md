# Machine learning
 
This repository contains my solutions to the assignments from the Machine Learning module at the University of Trier. The topics covered include:

- Classification
- Clustering
- Regression (linear and logistic)
- Ensemble learning
- Neural networks (MLP, CNN, RNN, Autoencoder)
- Reinforcement learning from scratch
